# Optical design
Numerical and analytical model used for building a Hexastorm.
The analytical model is contained in analytical.py
The numerical model is contained in simulation.py.
The article where the model and the technology for the Hexastorm is outlined is available [here](http://reprap.org/wiki/Transparent_polygon_scanner). 
A presentation on the technology is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLrt0U69ZLI).
The Zemax lens is contained in zmax_49332ink.zmx. Installation info for Rayopt is available [here](https://github.com/jordens/rayopt).
Note that the glass and stock catalogs need to be grabbed from the Windows installation to parse the lens data. The program also works under Linux.
